# datascience-getting-cleaning-data

## Project Overview

This is a project from Getting and Cleaning Data of Coursera's Data Science.  

The project asks us to create an R script with the name "run_analysis.R" and perform the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Base Data

Base data is obtained from the Zip file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  It contains the following files.
